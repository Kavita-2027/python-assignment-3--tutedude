# Assignment 3 - Python Basic Math Tasks

This repository contains solutions to **Assignment 3**, which includes two Python tasks focused on mathematical computations using built-in functions and modules.

## 🔧 Tasks Overview

### ✅ Task 1: Factorial of a Number
- This script takes a number as input from the user.
- It calculates the **factorial** using a `for` loop or a built-in method.
- The result is then displayed on the screen.

### ✅ Task 2: Mathematical Functions using `math` Module
- This script prompts the user to enter a number.
- It then calculates and displays the:
  - **Square Root** of the number
  - **Natural Logarithm (log base e)** of the number
  - **Sine Value** (in radians)

> **Note:** Task 2 uses Python’s built-in `math` module.

## 📂 Files Included

- `task1_factorial.py` – Script to compute factorial of a number.
- `task2_math_functions.py` – Script to compute square root, log, and sine using `math` module.

## ▶️ How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed. Then, run the scripts from the terminal or any Python IDE:

```bash
python task1_factorial.py
python task2_math_functions.py
